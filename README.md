These Ansible playbooks can be used to renew bootstrap certificates in
OpenShift v3.x.  The manual process is described here:

https://access.redhat.com/solutions/3782361

This repository contains the following playbooks:

Primary playbook:
update-bootstrap-certificates.yml: update bootstrap certificates

Optional playbooks:
approve-certificates.yml: approve all pending certificate signing requests (CSR).
delete-certificates.yml: delete all pending CSRs.

Note:
The update playbook will perform a rolling restart of the OpenShift API services
across all nodes.  As long as there is sufficient capacity (more than 1 node of
each type), there should be no outage in OpenShift availability.
